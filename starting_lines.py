#conditional statements if else elif all are used to check the conditions and break the loop if the condition is met

#Day two practice
#adding various numbers

#the above is a simple example of adding numbers in a list using a for loop
#the for loop will iterate through the list and add the numbers to the counter

#Day three practice
# finding duplicates in a list

#the above class shows a simpe example of a class with two attributes make and model
#two objects car1 and car2 are created using the class car
#the object car1 is printed to show the model attribute

#Day six practice

#Day 7 Practice!
# Reading files in python
